# Product Context: Quick & Healthy Recipe PWA

## Project Purpose

The Quick & Healthy Recipe PWA is designed to solve a specific problem for busy parents: finding and preparing healthy, affordable meals quickly on weekday evenings. Unlike general recipe websites that offer thousands of options, our PWA focuses exclusively on recipes that are:

1. **Quick to prepare** (under 30 minutes total time)
2. **Nutritionally balanced** (meeting basic dietary requirements)
3. **Budget-friendly** (using affordable, accessible ingredients)
4. **Family-friendly** (appealing to both adults and children)

## Target Users

### Primary User: Busy Parents
- Working full-time with limited time for meal preparation
- Concerned about providing healthy meals for their family
- Budget-conscious and looking to minimize food costs

- May have limited cooking skills or confidence

### Secondary Users:
- College students looking for affordable, quick meals
- Single professionals with limited cooking time

## Key Problems Solved

1. **Decision Fatigue**: Reduces the overwhelming number of recipe choices to a curated selection that meets specific criteria
2. **Time Constraints**: Focuses exclusively on recipes that can be prepared quickly on weeknights
