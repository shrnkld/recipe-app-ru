# Active Context: Quick & Healthy Recipe PWA

## Current Focus
We are in the implementation phase of the Quick & Healthy Recipe PWA project. The current focus is on:

1. **PWA Features**: Implementing and testing service worker for offline functionality
2. **Responsive Design**: Ensuring the application works well on all device sizes
3. **Performance Optimization**: Improving loading times and overall performance

## Recent Decisions

### Implementation Decisions
- **Vanilla JS Approach**: Successfully implemented core functionality using vanilla JavaScript without a framework
- **Component-Based Structure**: Organized JavaScript code into modular components (FilterSystem, RecipeCard, RecipeDetail)
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Using custom events for communication between components
- **Static JSON Data**: Implemented with a static JSON data file containing sample recipes
- **Image Handling**: Removed image elements to improve user experience when images are missing
- **Simple HTTP Server**: Created a basic Node.js server for local development

### UX Decisions
- **3-Button Filter System**: Implemented the simplified filtering focused on time, nutrition, and budget
- **Card-Based UI**: Created recipe cards with essential information for quick scanning
- **Modal Detail View**: Implemented a modal for detailed recipe information
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Essential information shown on cards, with details available on demand
- **Prominent Action Buttons**: Added styled "View Recipe" buttons for better visibility and interaction

## Current Challenges
- **Service Worker Implementation**: Ensuring proper caching and offline functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Optimizing the layout for various screen sizes
- **PWA Icons**: Need to create and implement proper icons for the PWA

## Next Steps

### Immediate Tasks
1. Implement and test service worker:
   - Verify caching strategy
   - Test offline functionality
   - Ensure proper asset caching
2. Create PWA manifest:
   - Define app name, description, and theme colors
   - Create and add app icons in various sizes
   - Configure display mode and orientation
3. Optimize responsive design:
   - Test on various screen sizes
   - Adjust layout as needed
   - Ensure touch-friendly UI on mobile devices

### Short-Term Goals
1. Implement favorites functionality
2. Add loading indicators and error states
3. Improve accessibility features
4. Add "Add to Home Screen" prompt

### Medium-Term Goals
1. Enhance offline capabilities
2. Consider adding more advanced filtering options
3. Implement user preferences storage
4. Add recipe sharing functionality

## Open Questions
- Should we implement a search functionality in addition to the filter system?
- How should we handle user preferences for favorite recipes?
- Should we add a "random recipe" feature for users who can't decide?

## Recent Changes
- Modified recipe card and detail components to handle missing images
- Improved the "View Recipe" button styling for better visibility
- Created a simple HTTP server for local development
- Tested core functionality and verified it works as expected

This document will be updated regularly as the project progresses and decisions are made.
