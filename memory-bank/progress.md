## Recent Progress Notes

**[Date: 05/03/2025]**
- Initialized Memory Bank with core documentation
- Defined project brief and requirements
- Established technical approach and architecture
- Documented current context and next steps
- Created basic project structure with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files
- Implemented core components (filter system, recipe cards, recipe detail view)
- Added sample recipe data in JSON format
- Set up PWA manifest and service worker files
- Created a simple HTTP server for local development
- Modified recipe card and detail components to handle missing images
- Improved the "View Recipe" button styling for better visibility
- Tested core functionality and verified it works as expected

The application now has a functional UI with the 3-button filter system and recipe cards. Users can filter recipes by time, nutrition, and budget considerations. Recipe details can be viewed by clicking on a recipe card or the "View Recipe" button. The next steps involve testing the service worker implementation and ensuring offline functionality works as expected.

This document will be updated regularly as development progresses.
