# Project Brief: Quick & Healthy Recipe PWA

## Project Overview

The Quick & Healthy Recipe PWA is a Progressive Web Application designed to help busy parents find and prepare healthy, affordable meals quickly on weekday evenings. The application focuses on simplicity, speed, and offline functionality to provide a seamless user experience.

## Core Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Recipe Filtering**
   - Users must be able to filter recipes by time (quick), nutrition (healthy), and budget (affordable)
   - Filters must be combinable (e.g., quick AND healthy)
   - Filtering must work offline

2. **Recipe Display**
   - Recipe cards must show essential information (title, time, cost, tags)
   - Recipe details must include ingredients, instructions, and nutrition information
   - Recipe substitutions must be provided where applicable

3. **Offline Functionality**
   - All recipes must be available offline
   - Filtering and viewing must work without internet connection
   - Application must be installable as a PWA

4. **Performance**
   - Initial load must be under 2 seconds on 3G connections
   - Application must be responsive on all device sizes
   - Interactions must be smooth and immediate

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Usability**
   - Interface must be intuitive and require minimal learning
   - Design must be clean and focused on content
   - Typography must be readable in kitchen environments

2. **Accessibility**
   - Application must be usable with screen readers
   - Color contrast must meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards
   - All functionality must be available via keyboard

3. **Maintainability**
   - Code must be well-documented and follow best practices
   - Components must be modular and reusable
   - Dependencies must be minimal

## Target Audience

### Primary Users
- Busy parents with limited time for meal preparation
- Health-conscious individuals looking for nutritious options
- Budget-aware shoppers seeking affordable meal solutions

### User Stories

1. **Quick Filter User**
   > "As a busy parent, I want to quickly find recipes that take less than 20 minutes to prepare, so I can make dinner after work without stress."

2. **Nutrition-Focused User**
   > "As a health-conscious parent, I want to find nutritionally balanced recipes, so I can ensure my family eats healthy meals."

3. **Budget-Conscious User**
   > "As a parent on a budget, I want to find affordable recipes, so I can provide healthy meals without overspending."

4. **Offline User**
   > "As a user with limited data, I want to access recipes offline, so I can view them while shopping or cooking without using data."

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- Recipe filtering by time, nutrition, and budget
- Recipe display with detailed information
- Offline functionality via PWA capabilities
- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Basic recipe data (6-10 recipes for MVP)

### Out of Scope
- User accounts and authentication
- Recipe creation or editing
- Social sharing features
- Advanced search functionality
- Meal planning and shopping lists

## Technical Approach

### Technology Stack
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- Service Workers for offline functionality
- Web App Manifest for installability
- Node.js for local development server

### Architecture
- Component-based architecture
- Event-driven communication
- Static JSON data for recipes
- Cache-first strategy for offline support

## Success Criteria

1. **Usability**
   - Users can find and view recipes in under 3 interactions
   - Users can filter recipes by multiple criteria
   - Users can access all functionality offline

2. **Performance**
   - Lighthouse score of 90+ in all categories
   - Initial load under 2 seconds on 3G
   - Smooth interactions with no perceived lag

3. **Adoption**
   - Users install the PWA to their home screen
   - Users return to the application for multiple sessions
   - Users access recipes offline

## Timeline

### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- Project setup and architecture
- Basic UI components
- Recipe data structure

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Current)
- Filter system implementation
- Recipe card and detail views
- Basic styling and responsiveness

### Phase 3: PWA Features
- Service worker implementation
- Offline functionality
- Installability

### Phase 4: Refinement
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- User testing and feedback

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work offline
- Must be installable as a PWA
- Must be responsive on all device sizes

### Business Constraints
- Must be simple enough for non-technical users
- Must focus on core functionality over features
- Must prioritize performance and usability

## Stakeholders

- **End Users**: Busy parents looking for quick, healthy, affordable recipes
- **Development Team**: Responsible for implementation and maintenance
- **Product Owner**: Responsible for requirements and prioritization
